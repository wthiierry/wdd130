    <h2>
      • Website Idea:
      The idea of my website is for people who are planning any kind of event
      (kids’ parties, graduation parties, weddings, bachelor parties, etc.),
      they can come to my website and easily plan their event, with easy access to information, images, testimonies,
      contact, etc.
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      On the home page, the person who is navigating will see images of the event’s place we have,
      along with some images of previous clients that allowed us to share their event content on our webpage.
      A short text describing who we are, where we are located, and what we can do for them to release the burden that
      is planning an event.
      Our buffet options, with options from cheap to expensive events.
      There will also be testimonies of previous customers, providing the visitor with quick stories so they can see we
      are trustworthy and what we can do to make their lives a lot easier.
      People might come to my website also looking for cheaper event planning, so I intend to make all the prices clear
      to the client, that way, the customer will know from the beginning how much it will take him to plan his event.
      Whoever is looking to plan an event, will come to my website instead of others because I will have strong social
      media marketing and the website will be very easy to scroll through and get all the necessary information to begin
      the event planning, and make his event a day to enjoy, and not a burden.

    <img src="images/decoration.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
    

    </ul>
    <h3>Our Services</h3>
    <p>
      My idea for a second page, (the name for this one might be “About Us or Our Services” or something like this.) is
      to have a short text telling our story in the event planning market, such as how long we’ve been in the market,
      stories about the space of the event, along with more images of our space (these images will be historical images
      from the space, creating a timeline, so customers can see how much the space has improved along the years).

    <img src="images/old.jpg" alt="image for Our Services Page">

    </ul>
    <h3>Gallery</h3>
    <p>
      Third Page Idea: This page will be a gallery, containing a lot of images from previous successful events hosted in our space.
      I want to provide images of successful events that we made, so that, when my customers enter my website, they can
      have visual content that will easily show them what to expect from our services (things like quality of the
      service, testimonies of previous customers, etc.)
      Also, I want to have an institutional video to provide the customer with a quick view of what they can expect.

    </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contat Us</h3>
    <p>
      Fourth Page Idea: The idea for this page is very simple, will be a contact page, with our social media, and an email us page.
      Here will also have information about all our partners, with a quick description about what they provide and their
      respective contacts.
      They also might come to my website expecting personalized customer service, from the moment they hire our services
      to the event itself I want to provide the customer a personalized service, so they can ask questions and eliminate
      any doubts quickly.

    </ul>
    <h3>Blog</h3>
    <p>
      Fifth Page Idea: There will be the fifth page, this page is going to be a blog, with ideas for clothing colors, decorations, music,
      flower arrangements, etc. This page is to be maintained by our own clients, they will be encouraged to post on the
      blog through our social media marketing.
