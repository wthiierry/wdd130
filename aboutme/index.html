    <p>Hey Everyone, greetings from Brazil, I'm 26, and I live in São Paulo, one of the biggest cities from Brazil, I served as a missionary for the Church in the Brazil - Vitória Mission,
        between 2016-2018. I got married in 2020 with the most strong and kind woman I've ever met, Geovana, and since November 2021 we have the cuttest little dog called Nasus.</p>
        <p>I'm in a change of carreers, so that's the main reason I began studying about Technology. Currently I work two jobs, the main one being a MRI (Magnetic Ressonance Imaging)
            technician, and the other one as a Intern in Atlassian Consultant/Jira Admin.</p>
        <p>The things that I love to do is to take walks through the park with my wife and dog, play video games, go out with friends to eat, and cook</p>
        <p>Talking about my life in the church, I'm a member since 2013, I was 16 years old when I got baptized and I'm the only member of the church in my family (aside from my wife)
           but I have faith that one day I will baptize my father, mom and sister</p>
